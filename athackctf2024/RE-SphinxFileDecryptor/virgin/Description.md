Hidden within the server backups, an intriguing binary surfaced within a user's directory. Our team managed to extract it; however, the transfer halted abruptly before completion.

The binary appears to be linked to file decryption, but access is impeded by a password requirement.

Given our access to the machine backups, our chief security officer, Dr. Kerberos, proposed examining the SAM and SYSTEM files. From our investigation, we uncovered the following hash: 6E4272E4CABA29B447B31B7E24F94151

Furthermore, we were able to extract the password policy from the domain controller, revealing it to be 8 letters followed by 4 integers.

Your task is to decipher the contents of this file expediently!
