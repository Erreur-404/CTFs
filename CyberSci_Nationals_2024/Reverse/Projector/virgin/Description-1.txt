We purchased an advanced projection system for our talks but in the chaos of getting ready for the conference we lost the purchase contract and the license information. It is now a few hours before the presentations start, and we are desperate - we cannot get the projector working! :'(

Luckily this is a security conference and we have a few talented reverse engineers in our midst. We pulled the projector's firmware - can you please help us figure out the license information, so that we could start the darn thing?!

The first step is the license key, this should be an easy one.
