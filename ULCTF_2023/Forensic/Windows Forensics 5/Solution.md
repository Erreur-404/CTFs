First, you can look at the Microsoft-Windows-DeviceSetupManager%4Admin logs and find that a samsung device was added around 9:04:47. However, even with the informations you could find in the logs, you couldn't get the flag as the actual information can only be found in the registry.

When opening the .reg file in the registry editor (make sure to open it in read-only as it will break your system otherwise) you can find the USB devices that are known by the registry by going to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB. Since we know that we are looking for a Samsung device, we can use the search functionality and find it. We then find ourselves in the VID_04E8&PID_6860&MI_00 folder where we can find the modele of the "HackerPhone" under the "DeviceDesc" key. The modele is SM-G781W, which gives us the flag:

ULCTF-SM-G781W
